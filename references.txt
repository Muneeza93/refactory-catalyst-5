Developing countries are recording encouraging results of more children enrolling in schools. However, a 2018 World Development Report shows that an increase in school enrollment doesnâ€™t automatically translate to learning. The report indicates that 53% of all children in low- and middle-income countries cannot read and understand a short story by the time they are finishing primary school. This is known as learning poverty.
